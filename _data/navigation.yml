# _data/navigation.yml
#
# This file defines the navigation structure for the sidebars in the Minimal Mistakes theme.
# Each top-level key (e.g., "engineering") represents a unique sidebar.
# The `collection` key automatically pulls in all documents from a specified collection
# and sorts them by the 'order' value in their front matter.
